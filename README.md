# Image Classification with Quantum Circuits RNNs

This code performs Image Classification for the MNIST dataset using Quantum Machine Learning (QML) Methods.

QML is based on Parametrised Quantum Circuits (PQC) with multiple angle parameters that will be trained to obtain a specific measurement for a quantum circuit. 

The specific QML method used in this project is the Quantum Neural Network. 

For the image classification with 10 labels, there are three methods available:

1) Free Fermionic Quantum circuit: a classically simulable quantum method using matchgates.
2) Fully Quantum Circuit: a generic quantum circuit.
3) Classical Circuit: a generic classical RNN

For each, the number of layers and the hidden size/number of qubits can be changed.

The MNIST dataset should download with the code provided/

Requirements for this project are in the **requirements.txt** file.

Run with **python3.11**
